# Cloak of Arachnida 
_Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)_ 

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

* You have resistance to poison damage.
* You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
* You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.
* You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.
* You can use an action to cast the **_web_** spell (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak can't be used again until the next dawn.
