description: Ability descriptions and modifier rules from the 5th Edition (5e) System Reference Document (SRD)

# Ability Scores 
Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics: 

* **Strength**, measuring physical power 
* **Dexterity**, measuring agility
* **Constitution**, measuring endurance
* **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
* **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
* **Charisma**, measuring force of personality 

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities--a creature's assets as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game--the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll--rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number. 

## Ability Scores and Modifiers 
Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

| Score | Modifier |
|-------|:--------:|
| 1     | -5       |
| 2-3   | -4       |
| 4-5   | -3       |
| 6-7   | -2       |
| 8-9   | -1       |
| 10-11 | +0       |
| 12-13 | +1       |
| 14-15 | +2       |
| 16-17 | +3       |
| 18-19 | +4       |
| 20-21 | +5       |
| 22-23 | +6       |
| 24-25 | +7       |
| 26-27 | +8       |
| 28-29 | +9       |
| 30    | +10      |
