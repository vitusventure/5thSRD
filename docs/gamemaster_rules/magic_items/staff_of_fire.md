# Staff of Fire 
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_ 

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: **_burning hands_** (1 charge), **_fireball_** (3 charges), or **_wall of fire_** (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
