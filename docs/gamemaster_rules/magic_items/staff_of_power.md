# Staff of Power 
_Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)_ 

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2 charges.

**Power Strike.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

**Spells.** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: **_cone of cold_** (5 charges), **_fireball_** (5th-level version, 5 charges), **_globe of invulnerability_** (6 charges), **_hold monster_** (5 charges), **_levitate_** (2 charges), **_lightning bolt_** (5th-level version, 5 charges), **_magic missile_** (1 charge), **_ray of enfeeblement_** (1 charge), or **_wall of force_** (5 charges).

**Retributive Strike.** You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. 

| Distance from Origin  | Damage                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 10 ft. away or closer | 8 x the number of charges in the staff |
| 11 to 20 ft. away     | 6 x the number of charges in the staff |
| 21 to 30 ft. away     | 4 x the number of charges in the staff |
