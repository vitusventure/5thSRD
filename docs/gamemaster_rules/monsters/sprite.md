### Actions 
**Longsword.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 1 slashing damage.    
**Shortbow.** _Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.    
**Heart Sight.** The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.    
**Invisibility.** The sprite magically turns invisible until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is invisible with it.
