**Ice Walk.** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.    
**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.    
**Bite.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage.    
**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.    
**Tail.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.    
**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.    
**Cold Breath (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Legendary Actions 
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.    
**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.    
**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.   
**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
