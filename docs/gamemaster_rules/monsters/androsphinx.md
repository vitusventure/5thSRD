**Spellcasting.** The sphinx is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. The sphinx has the following cleric spells prepared:    
Cantrips (at will): **_sacred flame, spare the dying, thaumaturgy_**    
1st level (4 slots): **_command, detect evil and good, detect magic_**

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The sphinx makes two claw attacks.    
**Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.    
**Roar (3/Day).** The sphinx emits a magical roar. Each time it roars before finishing a long rest, the roar is louder and the effect is different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.    
**First Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.    
**Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.    
**Third Roar.** Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
