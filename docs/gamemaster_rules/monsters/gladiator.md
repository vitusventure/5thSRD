**Brave.** The gladiator has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.    
**Brute.** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the gladiator hits with it (included in the attack).

### Actions 
**Multiattack.** The gladiator makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.    
**Spear.** _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.    
**Shield Bash.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Reactions 
**Parry.** The gladiator adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the gladiator must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

### Description
Gladiators battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some gladiators are brutal pit fighters who treat each match as a life-or-death struggle, while others are professional duelists who command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.
