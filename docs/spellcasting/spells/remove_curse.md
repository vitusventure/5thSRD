# Remove Curse 
_3rd-level abjuration_ 

**Casting Time:** 1 action    
**Range:** Touch    
**Components:** V, S    
**Duration:** Instantaneous 

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
